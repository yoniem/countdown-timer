### Instructions for Updating the `README.md`

1. **Replace placeholders:**
   - Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.
   - If you have a screenshot of your project, save it as `screenshot.png` in the root directory of your project. If not, you can remove the "Screenshots" section from the `README.md`.

2. **Save the `README.md` file:**
   - Save the above content in a file named `README.md` in the root directory of your project.

3. **Add, commit, and push the `README.md` file to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Add README file"
   git push origin main
